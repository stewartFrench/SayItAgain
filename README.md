SayItAgain is an Apple iPhone or iPad app used when transcribing audio
recordings, i.e., listening to a recording while typing out what is
heard into a text editor.  SayItAgain will play back your audio
recording and allow you to slow it down and back up to replay with the
tap of a button or press of a foot pedal.  This is similar to the old
Panasonic RR-830 Standard Cassette Transcriber.  You then use your
fingers on a keyboard and type in the corrections!  You can use Notes,
TextEdit, MS Word, Emacs, or whatever text editor you are most
familiar with.

For example, perhaps you submitted your parents Story Of A Lifetime to
one of the automated transcription tools, like OpenAI Whisper or
Deepgram or Google Speech-to-Text, and found that the results were
riddled with errors.  You now must go through and manually correct the
errors, get the proper names right, work out that deep Kentucky
accent.

SayItAgain is a free app.  I have released the SwiftUI source code to
github.  If you make any changes I would appreciate you letting me
know so I can consider adding them.
